A simple project for restoring and decompiling luac files from some common IoT vendors

Supports [unluac](https://sourceforge.net/projects/unluac/) and [luadec](https://github.com/viruscamp/luadec)

Since the code decompiled by unluac contains a lot of redundant code, I wrote a simple regular expression-based code optimizer that can reduce the amount of code by about 50%.(Only test for xiaomi)
